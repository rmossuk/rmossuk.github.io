Doing this allows you to group related changes together and commit just those changes or roll back the changes.\r\n\r\nIf you do not create a DS.Transaction and add changes to it, EmberData with use the 'defaultTransaction' and add all changes to this global transaction.  This mean that when you commit, all changes with be saved.\r\n\r\n### DS.Transaction\r\nWithin DS.Transaction we get the store, the stores adapter and the stores defaultTransaction to use.  Then we get the stores 'relationships'.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
