{"name":"EmberData - What happens when you commit ?","tagline":"Deep dive into the EmberData commit process","body":"I have been using Ember.js and EmberData for a long time now and most of my battles still seem to be in EmberData. Therefore i have decided to dive into EmberData and see exactly how the magic works and hopefully why the problems are happening, so that one day i may be able to help fix them !\r\n\r\nI am going to start with detailing the process of what actually happens when commit is called.\r\n\r\n### The test code\r\n\r\nI have this simple one-to-many relationship. ( Coffeescript )\r\n\r\n```\r\nApp.Product = DS.Model.extend \r\n  name: DS.attr('string')\r\n  children: DS.hasMany('App.BuildingBlocks')\r\n\r\nApp.BuildingBlock = DS.Model.extend \r\n  name: DS.attr('string')\r\n  parent: DS.belongsTo('App.Product')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have created and committed a product prior to this so now have access to App.product and now i want to add a building block to this product, so i have done\r\n\r\n```\r\nnewBuildingBlock = App.product.get(\"children\").createRecord()\r\nnewBuildingBlock.set(\"parent\", App.product)\r\nApp.store.commit()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis magically saves this of to my server but what actually happens ?\r\n\r\nLets follow it through the process.\r\n\r\n### DS.Store\r\nWithin DS.Store the commit method just delegates to the stores defaultTransaction's commit method.\r\n\r\nWith EmberData you can create multiple transactions and add specific creates, changes and deletes to any transaction.  Doing this allows you to group related changes together and commit just those changes or roll back the changes.\r\n\r\nIf you do not create a DS.Transaction and add changes to it, EmberData with use the 'defaultTransaction' and add all changes to this global transaction.  This mean that when you commit, all changes with be saved.\r\n\r\n### DS.Transaction\r\nWithin DS.Transaction we get the store, the stores adapter and the stores defaultTransaction to use.  Then we get the stores 'relationships'.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
